- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

It start the main thread first. The order is someAsyncOperation() foo() console.log('done')
Since in someAsyncOperation(), it is a IO operation. It will be put in eventloop. So the code will 
go to foo() and then console.log(). After the main thread is completed, the operation in eventloop is executed.
So the output is like this:

foo
done
