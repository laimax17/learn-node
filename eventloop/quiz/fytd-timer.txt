- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

First, we execute foo(2) first. And then put the bar(2) in pending callbacks. And then execute baz().
Then we execute foo(1). And then we put bar(1) in pending callbacks. And then execute baz().
After previous execution completed in the main thread, it starts to execute tasks in eventloop. 
Which are bar(2) and bar(1). 

So the out put is like this:

foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar
