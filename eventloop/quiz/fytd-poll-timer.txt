- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.

someAsyncOperation is a callback function, and it has a IO operation. The setTimeout is a timer event.
Both of them are put in event loop. It execute timeout first then someAsyncOperation.
 But timeout takes time, so someAsyncOperation is executed first. And then the result in setTimeout is printed.



- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?

No. The IO takes less time that timeout event.

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

Yes. timeout takes less time that IO event.
